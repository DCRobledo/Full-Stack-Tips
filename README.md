## [Singleton Pattern](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/danielcrobledo_singleton-pattern-in-full-stack-activity-7312730580851286016-6Sf4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAC2NYPIBAc8RXtHnKfsTt7ZC5Q6ed9h_1ks)
*React (TypeScript), Kotlin (Jetpack), Java (Spring Boot)*

> The Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides global access to it. It's commonly used for managing global states or shared resources across an application.
* **When to use it?:** Use the Singleton pattern when you need centralized access to a single instance across different parts of the application (e.g., configuration, database connections).
* **Example given:** Implementation of a config file accesible from anywhere to store some API URL
